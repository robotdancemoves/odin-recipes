    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>strawberries</li>
        <li>kiwi</li>
        <li>navel oranges</li>
        <li>shokupan (Japanese milk bread) slices – fluffy white sandwich bread
             that’s the thickness of a square loaf cut</li>
        <li>into 8 slices</li>
        <li>heavy (whipping) cream</li>
        <li>sugar – about 10% of the heavy cream by weight</li>
        <li>rum – optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Core/slice and dry the fruit.</li>
        <li>Make the whipped cream. Whisk the heavy whipping cream in bowl with
             a mixer on low speed. Add the sugar and rum. Whisk on medium-high 
             speed to medium peaks for a spreadable texture.</li>
        <li>Assemble the sando. Spread whipped cream on each slice of bread. 
            Line up the fruit on one slice along the center diagonal for an 
            attractive cross section when sliced. Add whipped cream to fill the
             gaps. Add the top slice.</li>
        <li>Wrap with plastic wrap and compress between plates. Refrigerate and
             keep chilled until ready to cut and serve.</li>
        <li>Slice the sandwich in half with a clean knife. Cut off the crusts. 
            Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips Cuz Ur Bad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plan the orientation of the fruit for a pleasing cross-section when
             you slice the sando.</li>
        <li>Use the same-size fruits and arrange them in a nice line.</li>
        <li>Wrap the sandwich tightly with plastic wrap to secure it.</li>
        <li>Weigh down the sandwich with plates and refrigerate it before you 
            cut it.</li>
        <li>Clean your knife after each cut so the whipped cream doesn’t 
            smear.</li>
    </ul>
